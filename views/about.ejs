          <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
          <p>
            I’m a software engineer and also a student at Seneca Polytechnic, where I’m constantly learning and improving my skills. I
            really enjoy helping people solve problems, whether it’s through coding, logical thinking, or creative solutions. Building
            useful tools, applications, and systems that make everyday tasks simpler and more efficient is something I find both meaningful
            and rewarding. I take pride in using technology to make life easier for others while continuing to grow as both a developer and
            a learner.
